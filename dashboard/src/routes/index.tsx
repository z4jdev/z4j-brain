/**
 * Root landing route at `/`.
 *
 * Two responsibilities, in order:
 *
 *   1. First-boot check. If the brain has not been set up yet
 *      (`/setup/status.first_boot == true`) we hard-redirect the
 *      browser to `/setup`, which is served by the brain itself.
 *
 *   2. Post-login branching. For an authenticated user we branch
 *      on membership count:
 *
 *        - 0 memberships AND not global admin → /settings/account
 *        - 0 memberships AND global admin     → /home (they can
 *          create/manage projects from there)
 *        - 1 membership                       → /projects/{slug}
 *        - 2+ memberships                     → /home
 *
 *      Unauthenticated users fall through to `/login`.
