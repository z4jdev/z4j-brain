"""Regression: a global brain admin (``user.is_admin=True``) MUST be
allowed to create a per-user subscription on any project, even if the
``Membership`` table has no row for them on that project.

The 1.3.2 hotfix story:

- ``GET /api/v1/auth/me`` synthesises an admin-grade membership row
  for every active project for global admins, so the dashboard's
  project switcher and the ``/settings/memberships`` page list them
  with full admin badges. The synthesis is a UI affordance — no row
  is written to the ``memberships`` table.
- ``POST /api/v1/user/subscriptions`` (the New Subscription modal)
  pre-1.3.2 queried the ``memberships`` table directly via
  ``MembershipRepository.get_for_user_project``. For a global admin
  the query returned ``None`` and the endpoint 403'd with
  *you are not a member of this project* — directly contradicting
  the dashboard, which had just rendered them as admin.
- The sibling ``GET /api/v1/user/subscriptions`` endpoint already
  used the ``not user.is_admin`` short-circuit. The POST had drifted
  out of sync. 1.3.2 switches the POST to the canonical
  ``PolicyEngine.require_member`` helper which handles the
  ``is_admin`` bypass uniformly.

This file exists to keep the bug from re-shipping a third time.
