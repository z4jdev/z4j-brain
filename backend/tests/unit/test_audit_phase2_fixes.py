"""Regression tests for Phase-2 audit findings.

Three fixes landed before declaring Phase 2 done:

- **HIGH-1**: ``lstrip("DNS:")`` in both mTLS interceptors stripped
  a SET of characters instead of the prefix. CNs starting with
  D/N/S/colon were silently mangled. Fixed via ``removeprefix``.
- **HIGH-2**: ``PendingFiresReplayWorker._apply_catch_up`` did one
  ``schedules_repo.get(schedule_id)`` per distinct schedule in the
  replay batch (N+1). Fixed via a single batched
  ``WHERE id IN (...)`` query.
- **MED-1**: The brain trigger route reached into
  ``dispatcher._settings`` (private). Replaced with a proper
  ``Depends(get_settings)`` and a process-wide singleton
  TriggerScheduleClient on ``app.state``.

These tests pin the fix so a future regression fails loudly.

    """Regression for the ``lstrip("DNS:")`` bug.

    Both interceptors (brain side and scheduler side) used
    ``str.lstrip`` to strip a hypothetical ``DNS:`` URI prefix
    that gRPC sometimes embeds in SAN entries. ``lstrip`` takes a
    SET of characters - so any leading D, N, S, or colon got
    eaten. A CN like ``Scheduler-1`` became ``cheduler-1`` and
    failed the allow-list, locking out a legitimate cert.

    Both interceptors now use ``str.removeprefix``. We test the
    brain side here; the scheduler side uses identical logic and
    is covered by ``packages/z4j-scheduler/tests/unit/test_audit_phase2_fixes.py``.
