"""Schema version tracking and startup compatibility check.

After Alembic migrations run and before the app starts serving,
this module:

1. Reads the ``schema_version`` from the ``z4j_meta`` table
2. Compares it to the current code version
3. If the DB schema is NEWER than the code -> log a warning and
   continue (v1.0.19 changed this from a hard error - see
   docs/MIGRATIONS.md for the bidirectional-compat contract).
4. If the DB schema is OLDER or equal -> update the record and proceed

v1.0.0..v1.0.18 raised :class:`SchemaVersionError` here, which
caused systemd flap loops on any operator who downgraded across
a migration boundary. From v1.0.19 onward, every additive
migration is designed so older code can ignore it - newer
features simply aren't available, but the brain stays up. The
contract is documented in docs/MIGRATIONS.md and enforced by
tests/integration/test_compat_matrix.py.
