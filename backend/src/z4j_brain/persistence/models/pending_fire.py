"""``pending_fires`` table - z4j-scheduler buffered-fire support.

Holds schedule fires that arrived from z4j-scheduler while no agent
was online for the schedule's engine. A background worker
(``PendingFiresReplayWorker``) replays these the moment a matching
agent comes online, honouring the schedule's ``catch_up`` policy.

Identified by the scheduler-generated ``fire_id`` (the same
idempotency key the dispatcher uses on its retries) so brain treats
duplicate FireSchedule attempts during the buffering window as
no-ops.

Per ``docs/SCHEDULER.md §11`` Phase 2.

class PendingFire(Base):
    """One schedule fire awaiting replay when an agent comes online.

    Attributes:
        id: Surrogate primary key.
        fire_id: Scheduler's idempotency key
            (``uuid5(NAMESPACE, schedule_id + scheduled_for_iso)``).
            Unique - duplicate FireSchedule retries collapse here.
        schedule_id: The schedule this fire belongs to.
            ``ON DELETE CASCADE`` so deleting a schedule clears any
            buffered fires for it.
        project_id: Owning project.
        engine: Engine adapter the agent must advertise to receive
            this fire (e.g. ``celery``, ``rq``).
        payload: The same dict ``CommandDispatcher.issue`` would
            receive at fire time. Kept verbatim so replay
            reproduces the exact original intent rather than
            re-deriving from the schedule (which the operator may
            have edited during the outage).
        scheduled_for: When the fire was originally meant to run.
            Used by the replay worker to order ``fire_all_missed``
            replays.
        enqueued_at: Wall-clock when brain buffered the fire.
        expires_at: After this time the sweep worker drops the
            row. Operators tune via
            ``Z4J_PENDING_FIRES_RETENTION_DAYS`` (default 7d).
