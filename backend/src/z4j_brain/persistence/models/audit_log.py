"""``audit_log`` table - append-only audit trail.

Every command execution and every privileged action writes a row
here. The migration installs database-level triggers that REVOKE
``UPDATE`` and ``DELETE`` from the public role and raise an
exception on attempted mutation - application-level guards alone
are not sufficient for an audit trail.

Each row also carries a per-row HMAC-SHA256 over its canonical
content, computed by :class:`AuditService` using
``settings.secret`` as the key. The verifier is exposed via the
``z4j-brain audit verify`` CLI subcommand. Combined with the
append-only trigger, this gives us tamper-evidence for any
modification short of a privileged DBA who also holds the master
secret.

Retention is handled out-of-band by a privileged role that bypasses
the trigger. Intentional, audited exception.
