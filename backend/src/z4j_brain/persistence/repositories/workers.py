        from the Celery signal's ``hostname`` (e.g.
        ``celery@web-01``). Workers with zero events are simply
        absent from the dict; the API layer fills zero-defaults so
        the dashboard table stays uniform.

        SQL is dialect-portable: ``payload->>'worker'`` works on
        Postgres + SQLite (the ``->>`` JSON-extract operator is
        supported by both). ``GROUP BY`` keeps the work on the

        ``processed = succeeded + failed`` (the conventional
        Celery-flower meaning - retries do NOT count as processed
        since the task has not finished). We expose all four so
        the dashboard can render Total / Succeeded / Failed /
        Retried columns separately.

        Round-7 audit fix R7-HIGH (perf) (Apr 2026): the prior
        version had no ``since`` bound and no LIMIT, so every
        Workers tab refresh did a full GROUP BY across the entire
        partitioned ``events`` history. Defaults to a 24-hour
        window now (matches dashboard intent: "what's each worker
        done recently"). Callers wanting all-time totals must pass
        ``since=datetime.min`` explicitly so the cost is opt-in.
