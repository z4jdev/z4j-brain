"""Async SQLAlchemy engine + session lifecycle.

The brain owns a single ``AsyncEngine`` per process. Sessions are
opened per request via the ``get_session`` FastAPI dependency, which
yields an ``AsyncSession`` and closes it when the handler returns.
``DatabaseManager`` is the small object the app factory holds onto so
shutdown can dispose of the engine cleanly.
