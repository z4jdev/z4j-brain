"""Audit-log retention sweeper (1.2.2+).

Periodically deletes ``audit_log`` rows older than
``settings.audit_retention_days``. Wired into brain's lifespan so
it starts on boot and stops cleanly on shutdown.

Why bother:

- The audit trail grows linearly forever. A homelab brain doing
  10 actions/sec (~860k rows/day) hits 30M rows in a month and
  starts choking the dashboard's ``ORDER BY occurred_at`` paged
  reads. 90 days is enough trail for forensics; older rows are
  noise.
- Operators have asked for a "set retention and forget" knob
  rather than an external cron + ``DELETE`` script.

How it works:

- Postgres: opens ONE transaction per batch, ``SET LOCAL
  z4j.audit_sweep = 'on'`` (the trigger function added in
  ``2026_05_01_0015_audit_sweep`` permits DELETE iff that GUC is
  on), then ``DELETE FROM audit_log WHERE occurred_at < cutoff``
  in batches. ``SET LOCAL`` dies at COMMIT/ROLLBACK so each
  batch's GUC scope is contained. A
  ``pg_try_advisory_lock(hashtext('z4j.audit_sweep'))`` at the
  top of the pass means only one brain replica holds the sweep
  at a time, the others see the lock fail and skip the pass
  cleanly. (Audit fix MED-15.)
- SQLite: no trigger; plain DELETE. Most homelabs run SQLite,
  so this is the common path. SQLite is single-writer so the
  advisory-lock dance is unnecessary.

The sweep runs on a fixed cadence
(``audit_retention_sweep_interval_seconds``, default 3600s = 1h).
Each pass deletes in batches of
``audit_retention_sweep_batch_size`` to avoid long-running
transactions, AND caps the *whole* pass at
``audit_retention_sweep_max_per_pass`` so a multi-million-row
backlog doesn't run as one runaway transaction window. Errors
are logged but never crash the task; the next tick retries.

The hash chain (``prev_row_hmac``) breaks at the boundary where
old rows are deleted. Verification of the surviving chain still
works from the new oldest row forward, which is the documented
behaviour of any time-based audit retention policy.
