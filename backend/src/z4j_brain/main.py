"""FastAPI application factory.

The single ``create_app`` callable is what uvicorn imports::

    uvicorn z4j_brain.main:create_app --factory --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080

Construction is split into discrete steps so each one can be
exercised independently in tests:

1. Resolve :class:`Settings` (from env, or supplied by the test)
2. Configure logging
3. Build the database engine + statement-timeout event hooks
4. Build the singletons (hasher, audit, auth, setup, ingestor,
   dispatcher, registry, worker supervisor)
5. Wire middleware (outermost first)
6. Mount routers + WebSocket gateway
7. Lifespan: first-boot check + start registry + start worker
   supervisor + dispose engine on shutdown

    # Dashboard SPA static mount (B6)
    # ------------------------------------------------------------------
    # The dashboard build is copied into ``settings.dashboard_dist`` by
    # the production Dockerfile. Mounted only when present so the test
    # suite (which never builds the dashboard) and the dev path
    # (Vite serves on its own port) both work without it.
    #
    # SPA fallback: TanStack Router owns every URL under the dashboard.
    # If an operator hard-refreshes ``/projects/default``, the browser
    # asks the brain for that exact path - there is no FastAPI route
    # for it, and a naive ``StaticFiles`` mount returns 404 because no
    # file exists at that path inside the dist. The fix is the
    # standard SPA-host pattern: mount the hashed asset directory
    # under ``/assets`` (so Vite's content-addressed bundles get
    # served directly with proper cache headers), and add a catch-all
    # route for everything else that:
    #
    #   1. tries to resolve the request to a real file inside the dist
    #      (favicon.svg, robots.txt, etc.) and serves it if found,
    #   2. otherwise falls back to ``index.html`` so the React router
    #      can take over client-side.
    #
    # The catch-all is registered LAST so it can't shadow ``/api/v1/*``,
    # ``/setup``, ``/metrics``, or the WebSocket routes - FastAPI
    # matches routes in declaration order.
