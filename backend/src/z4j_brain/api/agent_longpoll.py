"""HTTPS long-poll fallback for the agent transport.

Two endpoints, both bearer-authenticated, both speaking the v2
envelope-HMAC framing:

- ``POST /api/v1/agent/events`` - agent uploads a batch of signed
  outbound frames (event_batch, heartbeat, command_ack,
  command_result, registry_delta, error). The brain verifies each
  frame with the per-session :class:`FrameVerifier` and feeds them
  into the same :class:`FrameRouter` the WebSocket gateway uses,
  so the projection / audit / notification side-effects are
  byte-identical between transports.
- ``GET /api/v1/agent/commands?wait=N`` - long-poll for pending
  commands. Returns immediately with any already-pending commands
  for this agent; otherwise blocks up to ``wait`` seconds (capped
  at 60) waiting for the dashboard / API to issue one. Each
  response frame is freshly v2-signed by the per-session
  :class:`FrameSigner` so the agent can verify it through the
  same code path it uses on the WebSocket.

The endpoints are intentionally a 1:1 functional fallback for the
WebSocket - same auth, same framing, same routing, same audit
trail. The only loss vs WebSocket is latency: a long-poll round
trip is ~50-200 ms vs single-digit ms over an open socket.

Deployments behind corporate proxies that strip Upgrade headers
(observed in healthcare and finance environments in 2025) can
disable the WebSocket transport entirely and run on long-poll
without losing any control-plane functionality.

**Session lifecycle.** The agent generates a fresh
``X-Z4J-Session-Nonce`` value on every ``connect()`` and sends it
on every request. The brain keys its per-session signer/verifier
state by ``(agent_id, session_nonce)`` so:

- A benign agent reconnect (process restart, network flap) gets a
  new nonce, the brain rebuilds state to match. The seq counter
  on the previous session can never block the new one.
- An attacker who lands a forged frame (e.g. ``seq=2**63-1``) can
  only poison the *attacker's* session_nonce. The legitimate
  agent's session is unaffected.
- ``SignatureError`` always drops the cached state for that
  session, forcing whoever is on the other end to handshake fresh
  before any further frames are accepted.

The cache is bounded (LRU eviction at 4096 sessions) so a flood
of distinct nonces from any one agent cannot exhaust memory.

Multi-worker deployments still need a shared ``ReplayGuard``
state in Redis or Postgres for true HA - tracked in
``docs/ENTERPRISE_READINESS.md`` under "Phase 3 HA brain". For
single-worker deployments today, the ``X-Z4J-LongPoll-Worker``
response header carries the worker pid so operators can pin
agents to one worker via their load balancer.
