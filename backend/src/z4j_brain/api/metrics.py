"""``/metrics`` Prometheus scrape endpoint.

Exposes application-level counters, gauges, and histograms for
Grafana dashboards. The endpoint is mounted at the root (NOT
under ``/api/v1``) so Prometheus scrape configs use a stable path.

Authorization: optional bearer-token guard. Set
``Z4J_METRICS_AUTH_TOKEN`` and the endpoint requires
``Authorization: Bearer <token>``; leave it unset to keep the
legacy "open" behaviour, with a boot-time warning reminding the
operator to either set a token or block ``/metrics`` at the
reverse proxy (Caddy / nginx). Audit 2026-04-24 Medium-1.

Metric naming follows the Prometheus convention:
``z4j_{component}_{metric}_{unit}``.

These metrics are designed to be compatible with common Grafana
dashboard patterns used by Flower and Celery monitoring setups.
