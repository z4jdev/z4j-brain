"""Per-RPC handler implementations for the brain-side ``SchedulerService``.

The brain implements five of the six RPCs declared in
``packages/z4j-scheduler/proto/scheduler.proto``:

- :rpc:`ListSchedules` - server-streaming initial sync
- :rpc:`WatchSchedules` - server-streaming live diffs
- :rpc:`FireSchedule` - unary; creates a Command via ``CommandDispatcher``
- :rpc:`AcknowledgeFireResult` - unary; updates ``schedules.last_run_at``
- :rpc:`Ping` - unary liveness

The sixth RPC (:rpc:`TriggerSchedule`) lives on the scheduler side -
brain is the gRPC client for that one.

Per ``docs/SCHEDULER.md §13.2``, every state-changing RPC writes an
audit row through the existing HMAC-chained ``audit_log``. Pure read
RPCs (List/Watch/Ping) skip the audit because the scheduler reads
the same data on every reconnect; auditing each one would balloon
the log without operator value.

Phase 1 implementation notes:

- :rpc:`WatchSchedules` polls ``schedules.updated_at`` every
  ``Z4J_SCHEDULER_GRPC_WATCH_POLL_SECONDS`` (default 2s) and emits
  diff events. A future enhancement bolts on Postgres ``LISTEN`` for
  push semantics, but polling at 2s is well within the 100ms-target
  cache freshness budget when amortized against the scheduler's own
  tick cadence (250ms).
- :rpc:`FireSchedule` re-uses ``_pick_scheduler_agent`` from the REST
  handler so brain stays single-source-of-truth on agent selection.
