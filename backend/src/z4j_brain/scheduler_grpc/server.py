"""gRPC server lifecycle for the brain-side ``SchedulerService``.

Started by the brain's main lifespan when
``Z4J_SCHEDULER_GRPC_ENABLED`` is true. Bound to
``Z4J_SCHEDULER_GRPC_BIND_HOST`` :
``Z4J_SCHEDULER_GRPC_BIND_PORT`` (default ``0.0.0.0:7701``).

The server runs alongside the FastAPI process. It uses ``grpc.aio``
so it cooperates with FastAPI's asyncio loop without spawning a
threadpool. On shutdown, in-flight RPCs get a
``Z4J_SCHEDULER_GRPC_GRACE_SECONDS`` window to drain before the
runtime is torn down.

Wire-in pattern (called from ``z4j_brain.main._lifespan``):

    server = SchedulerGrpcServer(
        settings=settings,
        db=db,
        command_dispatcher=command_dispatcher,
        audit_service=audit_service,
    )
    await server.start()
    try:
        yield
    finally:
        await server.stop()

A disabled-via-settings server returns immediately on every
lifecycle method so callers don't need a separate gating branch.
