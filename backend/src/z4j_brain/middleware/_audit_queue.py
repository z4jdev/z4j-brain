"""Bounded async queue for denial-audit writes.

Round-4 audit fix (Apr 2026). The error middleware writes a
tamper-evident audit row for every denial / validation failure on
schedule-endpoint mutations (round-2 audit-on-denial fix). Pre-fix
the write opened a NEW DB session synchronously inside the request
scope — under attack (IDOR enumeration), every 4xx doubled the
per-request connection demand and starved the connection pool,
turning the audit safety net into a self-DoS amplifier.

This module gives the middleware a fire-and-forget enqueue path.
A single background drain task owns its own session and processes
denial events one at a time. The queue is bounded; on overflow we
drop the oldest event and increment a counter (operator's
"audit_queue_dropped_total" metric). Better to drop a denial-audit
row than to block the request handler.

Lifecycle:
    queue = AuditQueue()
    queue.start(db, settings)   # spawns the drain task
    queue.enqueue(event)        # called by middleware
    await queue.stop()          # called on lifespan shutdown
