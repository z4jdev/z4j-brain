"""In-process per-IP token bucket rate limiter.

Use as a FastAPI ``Depends(...)`` on individual endpoints that
need IP-level throttling but aren't worth the operational cost
of an external rate-limit store. v1 scope: a single brain
process; if the brain ever scales horizontally each replica gets
its own bucket and a determined attacker can multiply N×.

Memory bound: one ``deque`` per IP per bucket name. ``_BUCKET_TTL``
prunes entries idle for >5 min so a botnet hitting random IPs
can't grow the dict unbounded.
