"""``PartitionCreatorWorker`` - pre-creates daily events partitions.

The ``events`` table is PARTITION BY RANGE (occurred_at) with one
child table per day (e.g. ``events_2026_04_12``). The initial
migration pre-creates 7 days of partitions. After that this worker
takes over: once per hour it ensures partitions exist for today
and the next ``_LOOKAHEAD_DAYS`` days. If a partition already
exists the CREATE is a no-op (guarded by IF NOT EXISTS).

Without this worker, every INSERT into ``events`` after the
pre-created range expires fails with "no partition of relation
events found for row" - a production-fatal condition that was
flagged by the B7 audit.

The worker also handles retention: partitions older than
``settings.event_retention_days`` are dropped. This is the only
code path that deletes event data.

        Round-9 audit fixes (Apr 2026):

        - **R9-Stor-H1**: emit a WARN when the ``events_default``
          partition contains rows. The default partition is the
          catch-all for any ``occurred_at`` outside the daily
          windows; a row landing there means either the
          pre-creator missed a tick or an agent supplied a wildly
          out-of-range timestamp. Either way it requires operator
          attention — non-empty default partition silently blocks
          ``ATTACH PARTITION`` for that range later.
        - **R9-Stor-H2**: refuse to ``DROP`` a partition whose
          MAX(occurred_at) is past the cutoff. Pre-fix the worker
          parsed the partition NAME for the date and dropped on
          name alone — clock skew between worker and DB hosts, or
          a manually re-attached partition with rows from a
          different range, would silently destroy live data.
        - **R9-Stor-H3**: set ``lock_timeout='2s'`` before each
          ``CREATE PARTITION OF`` DDL. Pre-fix the DDL took
          ACCESS EXCLUSIVE on the parent for the duration; under
          heavy ingest a tick competing with INSERT statements
          would pile up waiters and the DDL would self-cancel
          mid-mutation against the catalog. Bounded
          ``lock_timeout`` lets the DDL fail fast and retry on
          the next tick, leaving the catalog clean.
