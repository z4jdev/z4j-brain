"""Event ingestion: agent → events table → tasks projection.

The :class:`EventIngestor` is the brain-side counterpart of the
agent's event capture path. For each event in an inbound
``event_batch``:

1. Re-apply the redaction engine (defense in depth - the agent
   already redacted, but if the agent is misconfigured or
   compromised we MUST scrub before storage).
2. INSERT into the partitioned ``events`` table. Idempotent on
   ``(occurred_at, id)`` so a re-connecting agent that replays
   buffered events does not duplicate.
3. Project the event onto the ``tasks`` table - upsert by
   ``(project_id, engine, task_id)``, applying the right state
   transition + lifecycle timestamps for the event kind.
4. Touch the ``queues`` table if the event mentions a queue we
   have not yet recorded.
5. Bump the agent's ``last_seen_at`` (event traffic counts as a
   heartbeat).

The class is dependency-injected with a :class:`RedactionEngine`
plus the four repositories it writes to. No SQLAlchemy imports,
no FastAPI imports, no implicit globals.

    Defends against:

    - **DoS via unpartitioned timestamp** (R3 finding C2): the
      partitioned events table only has partitions pre-created
      for a finite window. A timestamp outside that window
      raises ``no partition of relation "events" found`` on
      Postgres, blowing up the ingest. Clamping prevents this
      class of failure structurally.
    - **Dedupe-dodging via far-future ts**: an attacker picking a
      future ``occurred_at`` lands the row in a partition where
      no legitimate event will ever land - defeats the (limited)
      protection of the conflict key.

    Out-of-range values are clamped to ``now`` and a warning is
    logged so misbehaving agents are observable in Grafana.
