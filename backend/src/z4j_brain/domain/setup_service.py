"""First-boot setup service.

Two operations:

- :meth:`SetupService.is_first_boot` - true while ``users`` is empty.
- :meth:`SetupService.mint_token` - wipe any old token, generate a
  new 256-bit token, store its HMAC-SHA256 hash, return the
  PLAINTEXT (only ever returned by this call - never persisted).
- :meth:`SetupService.complete` - verify token, validate password,
  create the bootstrap admin, create the default project, write the
  audit row, delete the token. Race-safe via inner re-check.

Verification uses an HMAC of the supplied token (with
``settings.secret`` as key) and constant-time-compares to the
stored hash. Even an attacker who somehow gets the hash table cannot
precompute candidate tokens without the master secret.
