"""Notification delivery channels.

Each channel is a small async function that takes a config dict
(from NotificationChannel.config) and a payload dict (the
notification body), delivers the notification, and returns a
:class:`DeliveryResult`.

Channels are stateless - they don't hold connections or sessions.
The NotificationService constructs a fresh delivery on every fire.
Retry logic is owned by the service, not the channel.

Channel config shapes:

- webhook: {"url": "https://...", "headers": {"X-Custom": "val"},
            "hmac_secret": "optional-secret-for-signing"}
- email:   {"smtp_host": "smtp.gmail.com", "smtp_port": 587,
            "smtp_user": "...", "smtp_pass": "...",
            "smtp_tls": true, "from_addr": "alerts@example.com",
            "to_addrs": ["ops@example.com"]}
- slack:   {"webhook_url": "https://hooks.slack.com/services/..."}
- telegram: {"bot_token": "123456:ABC-DEF", "chat_id": "-100123456"}

    # PATCH time and the actual dispatch.
    #
    # We deliberately do NOT pin the TCP connect to the resolved
    # IP (the way ``deliver_webhook`` / ``deliver_slack`` do).
    # Rationale: aiosmtplib's STARTTLS path uses
    # ``asyncio.loop.start_tls(..., server_hostname=...)``, which
    # on Python 3.14 / Windows fails to honour the hostname
    # override - the TLS layer still verifies the peer cert
    # against whatever ``hostname`` the SMTP client was
    # constructed with. Pinning to an IP therefore makes TLS
    # reject every public SMTP host with an "IP address mismatch"
    # error. The workable paths are:
    #
    #   (a) pin to IP + disable ``check_hostname`` + manually
    #       ssl.match_hostname(peer_cert, original_host) after
    #       handshake - preserves DNS-pin but reimplements cert
    #       verification. Audit liability.
    #   (b) dial the hostname directly - aiosmtplib does one
    #       fresh resolve internally, TLS verifies correctly,
    #       and we accept the few-second rebinding window.
    #
    # We take (b): the threat model for SMTP channels is
    # fundamentally different from webhooks. SMTP creds sit in
    # channel config and are limited to what the remote SMTP
    # server permits; DNS rebinding to a private IP would need
    # the attacker to control DNS for the SMTP hostname, which
    # for public providers (Gmail / Mailgun / Brevo / SendGrid /
    # Postmark) is infeasible. For operator-run SMTP hosts, the
    # blocklist below on re-resolve still refuses private-range
    # hits. Audit 2026-04-24 Medium-5 (to be filed): the R5 H2
