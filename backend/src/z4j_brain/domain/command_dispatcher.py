"""Brain-side command dispatcher.

Different from the agent's :class:`z4j_bare.dispatcher.CommandDispatcher`
(which routes inbound commands to engine adapters). The brain-side
dispatcher does the OPPOSITE direction: an operator clicks "retry"
in the dashboard → this class persists the command, signs it, and
asks the registry to deliver it to whichever worker holds the
agent's WebSocket.

Public surface:

- :meth:`issue` - operator-initiated. Inserts the row, asks the
  registry to deliver, audits, returns the command.
- :meth:`handle_ack` - called from the frame router when an agent
  ACKs a command frame. Updates ``commands.dispatched_at``.
- :meth:`handle_result` - called when an agent returns a result.
  Updates ``status`` + ``result`` + ``error``.

Atomicity rules:

- The ``commands`` row INSERT and the NOTIFY publish happen in the
  same transaction. NOTIFY only fires on COMMIT, so if the INSERT
  rolls back the NOTIFY never fires.
- The ``mark_dispatched`` UPDATE has a ``WHERE status='pending'``
  guard so two workers racing to dispatch the same command cannot
  double-mark.
- ``CommandTimeoutWorker`` is the safety net: any command stuck in
  ``pending`` past ``timeout_at`` flips to ``timeout``.
