"""Version freshness checks for the dashboard's *Update available*
badge on the Agents page.

Privacy posture (1.3.4 design):

- The brain SHIPS with a bundled snapshot of the latest known
  versions of every z4j package, generated from
  ``sites/_shared/packages.ts`` at brain release time. This file
  is loaded at startup and used for every comparison by default.
  No network call. Air-gapped friendly.
- An operator can click *Settings -> Check for updates* to fetch
  a fresher snapshot from GitHub
  (``https://raw.githubusercontent.com/z4jdev/z4j/main/versions.json``).
  This is the ONLY case where the brain reaches out, and it's
  always operator-initiated. Result is cached in process memory
  so subsequent comparisons use the fresh data until the next
  restart.
- Operators who want zero outbound HTTP can set
  ``Z4J_VERSION_CHECK_URL`` empty; the dashboard hides the
  *Check for updates* button entirely and the bundled snapshot
  is the source of truth.
- Air-gapped operators with an internal mirror set
  ``Z4J_VERSION_CHECK_URL=https://internal-mirror/versions.json``.

There is no automatic background polling. There is no telemetry.
