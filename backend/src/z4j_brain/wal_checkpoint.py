"""SQLite WAL checkpoint task (1.2.2+).

SQLite in WAL mode (the default for our async aiosqlite engine)
accumulates pages in the ``-wal`` sidecar file as writes happen.
SQLite auto-checkpoints on a 1000-page threshold, which works
fine for write-light apps but lags badly when (a) the brain is
busy logging audit/event/command rows and (b) readers hold the
WAL open across many transactions.

The visible symptom on a homelab box is the ``brain.db-wal``
file growing into the hundreds of megabytes, which then breaks
``cp brain.db backup.db`` (the WAL holds uncheckpointed pages).

This task runs ``PRAGMA wal_checkpoint(PASSIVE)`` on a fixed
cadence (default every 5 minutes) so the WAL gets checkpointed
opportunistically without blocking concurrent readers/writers.
PASSIVE is the safe default; TRUNCATE (which forcibly resets
the WAL file) is reserved for an explicit operator action and
*not* the periodic loop, because it can stall behind a long-
running read transaction (audit fix MED-14).

Postgres deployments don't need this — the task detects the
dialect at start and exits cleanly if it's not SQLite.
